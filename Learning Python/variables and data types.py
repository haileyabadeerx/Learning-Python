#This is how to declare variables

name = "Hailey" #<-- strings
age = 20 #<-- numbers
is_girl = True #<-- booleans

print("There was once a young girl named " + name + ".")
print("She is " + age + " years old")

#can change the variable anywhere basta madeclare sya before the usage of it
name = "Kendra"
age = "15"
print(name + " likes to play videogames")
print("But being " + age + " makes her feel miserable")
